                <h1 class="faq-page">Do I need to apply sunscreen indoors?</h1>
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Given the reduced risk of UV exposure indoors, sunscreen is often not necessary. Despite the fact that clothing may be sufficient and sunscreen is typically not required, you should consider sun protection if you spend a lot of time by a window with direct sunlight.</p>

                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>You should wash your face in the morning for a variety of reasons, including the fact that bacteria can gather throughout the night and that you should prepare your skin for your daily skincare routine by washing it. You should also remove any overnight creams and serums that you used the night before.

<h1 class="faq-page">Should I use vitamin C in the AM or PM?</h1>
               
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Experts often recommend taking retinoids at night and vitamin C supplements in the morning. This approach frequently proves to be the most effective since retinol products can make the skin more sensitive to UV radiation, which is why it's best to save them for the eveningÂ use.
